# ethebriel

This repository contains my attempts at implementing some core ethereum algorithms/features for learning purposes.


## stack

The language chosen for theese studies was typescript since its the main language I'm using on a daily basis right now.

Once I feel satisfied with this project I'll most likely do everything from scratch in Go or C++.


## researching sources
I'm using [ethereum's documentations](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/) and [wiki's](https://eth.wiki/) (but not limited to) as study guides (aswell as every useful video/article/etc that the ethereum's documentation provides) so it actually takes a good amount of time to complete a specific topic, because I'll read multiple articles/documentation pieces on each topic.

I also consult [geth's](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and [ethereumjs'](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/client) source code if I feel like I need a better understanding of how something should be implemented. I try my best to keep this searches on geth's source code so I don't get the urge to copy paste stuff from ethereumjs, although sometimes that happens, I'll make sure to point out code snippets that were inspiration from any other repo.


## roadmap ? xd
Right now I'm still taking my time and going through ethereum's documentation / trying to implement stuff that I think I already understand.

The list of things I have already read about will be trying to implement next:

- RLP encoding, decoding (WIP)
- ETHash (actually this one I haven't read that much about but I'm pretty sure I'll need this before going to MPT)
- Merkle Patricia Tree

## testing
who needs tests? xd

## running
WIP

### observations
If I feel like it is worth I'll try to keep some kind of log of the stuff I'm learning/implementing/refactoring/finding out I don't actually understand after days trying to implement.

But right now most of the time is reading/watching videos and messing around with stuff, so this is probably something for the future.
